                    As a musician, I've used hundreds of different tools to help hone my craft. 
                    Of all of these tools, the most important has been the metronome. 
                    I've used dozens of different kinds of metronomes, 
                    but have always had an issue with their inability to save a setlist of tempos  
                    and the limited number of sound options they have. 
                    For this reason, I've created the Click! Metronome App.

                        The entertainment industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that has a ton of
                        influence on people around the world. The Popular Movies App is an app designed to help
